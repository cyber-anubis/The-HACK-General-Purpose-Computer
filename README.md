# The-HACK-General-Purpose-Computer

The Nand to Tetris project is about going into fascinating voyage of discovery in which you will go all the way from Boolean algebra and elementary logic gates to building a Central Processing Unit, a memory system, and a hardware platform, leading up to a general-purpose computer that can run any program that you fancy. 

Project 1: Building elementary logic gates like And, Or, Not, Multiplexor, and more ## 
Project 2: Building a family of adder chips, culminating in the construction of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) ## 
Project 3: Building registers and memory units, culminating in the construction of a Random Access Memory (RAM) ## 
Project 4: Learning a machine language and using it to write some illustrative low-level programs ## 
Project 5: Using the chipset built in projects 1-3 to build a Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a hardware platform capable of executing programs written in the machine language introduced in project 4 ## 
Project 6: Developing an assembler, i.e. a capability to translate programs written in symbolic machine language into binary, executable code. ##
